"<b> Describe what these Git commands do to the commit history:</b><br><br>```bash<br>git reset --hard HEAD~5<br>git merge --squash HEAD@{1}<br>```<br><br><ul><li>They reset the HEAD to the fifth commit in the repo, then merge to the master branch.</li><li>The current branch's HEAD is reset back five commits, then prior commits are squashed into a single commit.</li><li>They delete the last five commits.</li><li>They merge the last five commits into a new branch.</li></ul>","The current branch's HEAD is reset back five commits, then prior commits are squashed into a single commit.<br><br>**Explanation:**<br>- `git reset --hard HEAD~5` resets the current branch to the commit just before the last 5 (see `man gitrevisions` for details about this notation and other cool alternatives like `HEAD@{2 days ago}`). As it is a hard reset, it will also overwrite every change in the working tree as well. See `man git-reset`.<br>- `git merge --squash HEAD@{1}` HEAD@{1} is where the branch was just before the previous command (again, see `man gitrevisions`). This command sets the state of the index to be as it would just after a merge from that commit. This whole operation could be a way to take 5 commits from a branch in which you started a new feature and squash them to a single commit, a meaningful one.<br>"

<b> What does IL stand for?</b><br><ul><li>Intermediate Language</li><li>Intelligent Language</li><li>Intelligent Linq</li><li>Interpreted Language</li></ul>,Intermediate Language
<b> You want to create an instance of several families of classes. Which design pattern best fits this objective?</b><br><ul><li>Decorator</li><li>Singleton</li><li>Abstract Factory</li><li>Bridge</li></ul>,Abstract Factory
"<b> Which statement about a read-only variable is _not_ true?</b><br><ul><li>It can be either static or an instance memeber.</li><li>At run time, its value is evaluated.</li><li>It can be initialized in either the constructor or the declaration.</li><li>It can be initialized at declaration only.</li></ul>",It can be initialized at declaration only.
"<b> What is the interface segregation principle?</b><br><ul><li>Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.</li><li>Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.</li><li>A class should have only a single responsibility - that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.</li><li>Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.</li></ul>",Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
<b> Why would the .NET Framework use Econo-JIT (Just-inTime)?</b><br><ul><li>to compile only the methods that are called at run time and then store them in cache for one minute</li><li>to compile only methods called at run time - which are compiled the first time the methods are called and then stored in cache to be used for execution when the same methods are called again</li><li>to compile complete source code into native code in a single compilation cycle during deployment of the application</li><li>to compile only the methods that are called at run time and remove them from memory after execution</li></ul>,to compile only the methods that are called at run time and remove them from memory after execution
<b> What is the difference between a heap and a stack?</b><br><ul><li>The stack contains stored value types; the heap contains stored reference types.</li><li>The heap is stored value types; the stack is stored reference types.</li><li>The heap is stored object types; the stack is stored class types.</li><li>The stack is stored object types; the heap is stored class types.</li></ul>,The stack contains stored value types; the heap contains stored reference types.
"<b> What is open closed principle?</b><br><ul><li>software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.</li></ul>","software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
"<b> How do you make sure that the garbage collector is done running when you call `GC.Collect()`?</b><br><ul><li>There is no way to find this out.</li><li>You cannot. [`GC.Collect()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.gc.collect) is a blocking method, and will return only once the garbage collector is done running.</li><li>by calling [`GC.WaitForFullGCComplete()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.gc.waitforfullgccomplete)</li><li>by calling [`GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.gc.waitforpendingfinalizers)</li></ul>",<ul></ul>
"<b> What does JIT do in .Net?</b><br><ul><li>JIT is used for deployment, versioning, and security.</li><li>JIT translates the IL code to an assembly code and uses the CPU architecture of the target machine to execute a .NET application.</li><li>JIT compiles to C# code using .NET environment properties.</li><li>JIT is used for deployment, versioning, and security, and forces the computer's processor to execute the native machine code.Reference: [Compilation by the JIT compiler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/managed-execution-process#compilation-by-the-jit-compiler)<br></li></ul>",JIT translates the IL code to an assembly code and uses the CPU architecture of the target machine to execute a .NET application.
